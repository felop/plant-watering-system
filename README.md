An automatic watering system for my desk plant.

It's based on [teensy 4.1](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy41.html)

To do list:
[X] make a user interface (screen)
[X] reccord data about moisure
[ ] learn from it
[ ] integrate it in the main program
[ ] add more features (notify when the tank is empty, add UPS)
[ ] 3D print the final casing
[ ]
